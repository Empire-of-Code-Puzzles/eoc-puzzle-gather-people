    We need to be prepared for emergency situations, so it would be good for us to develop a model evacuation process.
    The rooms in the building are connected by corridors of various lengths (but they can be isolated).
    Each room may contain a varying number of occupants at any given time.
    We should calculate how many people can get to the evacuation zone by a given time.
</p>

<p>
    Room and hallway information can be represented in a matrix (M). Each room has a number from 0 to N where the matrix
    has size of NxN. In the diagonals we are given information about how many people occupy the room -- M[i][i] is how
    many people in the i-th room.<br>
    In other cells of the matrix, you are given an information about the hallways, specifically how much time (in
    minutes) is required to move from room i to room j (M[i][j] == M[j][i]). If time the is zero, then a hallway does
    not exist between these rooms. The evacuation zone is a room marked with the number 0 (zero).

</p>

<p>
    You are given a building matrix and evacuation time in minutes. People must always use the shortest path to evacuate
    the building. By the specified time, how many people will have escaped? For this mission, passing through a room
    doesnâ€™t take any time, only passing through hallways. A room will be considered evacuated if the total time to
    evacuate is less than or equal to the given time.

<p>
    For an example take a look at this image:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img title="example" src="{{MEDIA}}example.svg" alt="example"/>
</p>
<pre>[[ 0, 40,  0, 40,  0,   0],
 [40,  6,  0,  0, 40,   0],
 [ 0,  0,  3,  0, 15,   0]
 [40,  0,  0,  4, 40,  15]
 [ 0, 40, 15, 40,  1,   0]
 [ 0,  0,  0, 15,  0,   2]]
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    If the given time is 80, then rooms 1, 3, 4 and 5 will be completely evacuated and the result is 6+4+1+2=13.

</p>

<p>
    We have one more rule for this challenge. This is a code golf mission and your main goal is to make your code as
    short as possible. The shorter your code, the more points you earn. Your score for this mission is dynamic and
    directly related to the length of your code. For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used. 250
    characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points. For each character less than 250, you earn 1
    point. For example for 150 character long code earns you 100 points. In this mission we count whitespaces, but don't
    count indents.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Information about a building as a list of lists of integers and
    evacuation time as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number of people who escaped in time as an integer.
